# api-technical-test

Thank you for taking the time to attend the next stage of interview at comparethemarket!

# Instructions üìñ

We would like you to pair with an existing CTM employee to produce an API in `dotnet core` that has the following functionality:

* Search for users by email
* Retrieve details of an existing user (name, address, email address, phone number, role)
* Create a new user
* Update user details

We have taken the liberty of setting up a boilerplate API, which currently has a single endpoint. Please take a moment to verify this now with your pair.

# Additional Info

You may use any testing framework(s) of your choosing.

When assessing your test, we will take the following things into account:

* Design of your API
* Code quality
* Code clarity
* Approach(es) taken to testing

Feel free to ask any additional clarifying questions to your pair, good luck! üëç
